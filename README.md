# CAMPSITE
This repository contains all the code necessary to run the CAMPSITE model, and to recreate the analyses and figures described in Slavenko & Thomas Opposing effects of competition and selection on macroevolutionary dynamics.

The folder "code" contains the code to run a single iteration of the CAMPSITE model, and supporting functions to run analyses on outputs of simulations. Full descriptions of the model and its parameters, and the associated analyses, can be found in the manuscript.

The main folder contains the three following scripts:

1. simulations - code to run the simulations described in the manuscript, using different values for the parameteres controlling the strength of competition and selection.
2. plots - code to run all the post-hoc analyses on the simulations outputs and generate the associated figures which can be found in the manuscript.
3. empiric - code to extract metrics from the empirical datasets described in the manuscripts - the empirical data and phylogenies are found in the folder "empirical".
